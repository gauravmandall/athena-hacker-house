# üèÅ MonadLand ‚Äì 2D Racing Game üèÜ

Welcome to **MonadLand**, a 2D top-down racing game inspired by Atari's _Badlands_. This game was built **entirely from scratch**, without using any game engines.

Our goal was to explore game development fundamentals, with each team member focusing on core systems like rendering, physics, input, and AI. In particular, our AI system features **path-following opponents with obstacle avoidance** and collision curvature detection using **Linear Regression** over grid-based track data.
